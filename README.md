Color Scheme Generator, in short CSG, is a simple JavaScript app that returns a color scheme containing 5 colors based on an input color. 

The app uses The Color API (https://www.thecolorapi.com/). User can choose from one of 7 scheme modes: monochrome, monochrome-dark, monochrome-light, analogic, complement, analogic-complement and quad.
